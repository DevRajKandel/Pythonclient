We need to install "requests" module in the location where Python interpreter is located.

To install "requests" module, we need to have pip installed.

Use this command to see if pip is installed and if not, it will install the pip

 py -m ensurepip --upgrade

 Note when we use -m modifier, we are running the modules inside scripts folder in the root folder of Python

 py -m pip install --upgrade pip : This will upgarde the pip version

 Once pip is installed, we can install the package called as requests
 from cmd we need to write,
 pip -m py install requests
